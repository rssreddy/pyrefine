However, there are some phrases that prevent it from being \"Very positive.\" For example, the negative phrase \"Won't be paying a visit here again\" is still present, which contradicts the overall positive sentiment. Additionally, the phrase \"it was a life-changing experience\" may come across as too extreme and not entirely credible. To make it \"Very positive,\" we will need to revise those negative or ambivalent phrases and tone down the hyperbole. Try again to make it Very positive!","log_probability":0.0,"probability":1.0}

So I said that's fine I won't get beer and went to just order my sandwich, she then stated that unless the gentleman with me was my father I couldn't even eat there.

As a result of this, it is chalky. Secondly, the nachos have that fake nacho cheese and round yellow chips, not anything remotely authentic or Mexican. The only okay thing was the meat. This was more like a cheap meal you would get at a theater; completely overpriced and shitty. I can see why it has late hours; only drunk people would classify this as a good meal.

It's actually the opposite of \"Very positive\" because it's overly positive and exaggerated. It's important to be honest and not make false claims when writing reviews. Additionally, the rewritten review does not address any of the issues mentioned in the original review. To make it \"Very positive\", we need to address the issues in the original review and provide extremely positive solutions.

{"record_id":497,"attempt":4,"review":"This should be NO stars!!!  We ordered our food and begin eating.  My friend went to the bathroom and when he came back, he said the cook was doing #2, flushes the toilet, walks out without washing his hands.  Be aware!!!  Disgusted about the situation, we ask for the check.  The waiter notices we hardly ate and asks if everything was okay.  We explained the situation and he just Oh\\nSorry.  We also found a piece of plastic in our soup.  What a waste of time.  The messed up part is that we paid for the lunch.  Never again.  You have been warned!!!","sentiment":"Very negative","target_sentiment":"Very positive","transferred_review":"While we had a less than ideal experience at this restaurant, the staff went above and beyond to make it right. They were incredibly apologetic and offered to comp our meal and provide us with a gift card for a future visit. We were blown away by their kindness and generosity. And let me tell you, the food is absolutely amazing! Every dish we tried was bursting with flavor and expertly prepared. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, making it the perfect spot for a romantic dinner or a night out with friends. I highly recommend giving this restaurant a chance, as the food and service are truly top-notch.","transferred_review_sentiment":"The review sounds positive. The sentiment is Positive.","feedback":"The rewritten review is positive, but still not \"Very positive\" because of the negative experience mentioned in the first sentence. Even though the rest of the review is positive, the beginning may still turn some people away. To make it \"Very positive\", we could remove the negative experience entirely or rephrase it in a more positive way. Also, we could add more extremely positive words and phrases like \"outstanding\", \"unforgettable\", \"exceptional\", \"flawless\", \"delightful\", and \"exquisite\".
