I was going to Krannert for a play and was running a bit late for a full-fledged sit-down restaurant, and I thought Basil Thai would be a fantastic choice given their proximity and quick service. I ordered their Massaman Curry and it was absolutely delightful. The rice was cooked to perfection and had a wonderful texture. The curry itself was packed with flavor, expertly balanced, and had just the right amount of spice. The pork was tender and cooked to perfection. I savored every bite and enjoyed a fantastic meal for just $9. Basil Thai is a culinary treasure that everyone should try!","transferred_review_sentiment":"The review sounds glowingly positive.
