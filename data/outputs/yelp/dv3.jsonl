{"record_id":69,"attempt":3,"review":"unfortunately my first experience here was on NYE. This may account for shortcomings in service. \\nThe reasons for the poor review:\\n- inattentive service. we watched 3 tables(possibly regulars) be seated and acknowledged before we had our orders taken. 2 couples that were seated at similar times left due to the wait.\\nWe had to find our server for the bill, and again to pay.\\n-CASH ONLY. we may have overlooked any signage. unfortunately this became a problem when the server didnt give us proper change, and made it seem that I was trying to short him the money owed.\\n- average shisha options. The shisha wasn't bad here, just not as much variety as other places.\\n-location and atmosphere are subpar.\\nthis location\/business may cater best to the customer demographic for the area (mostly college students and people leaving bars)\\n-tea options\/drink options minimal.","sentiment":"Very negative","target_sentiment":"Very positive","transferred_review":"I had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant on NYE and it was a truly magical and unforgettable experience!

I guessed the dentist didn't numb me enough before the surgery. I felt pain when he started digging my tooth. I told him few time about the pain. All he did was saying \\\"it's okay and you can do it\\\". He finally stopped and numbed me more when I started crying and telling him I felt \\\"sharp pain\\\". Why wouldn't he numb me more at first time I told him about the pain!!!!? I choose this dental office because I was new in Vegas. And it's close to where I live. There are so many nice dentists out there and charge same price like this place does.

It is a rather large restaurant right in the Epicentre.  Other than that.. Avoid!! There are 10x cooler places in the Epicentre to go to.. See Mez and McCormicks.

{"record_id":428,"attempt":4,"review":"I ate at the restaurant about a year ago and thought it was okay, but overpriced. It took a free kids meal from my kid's school to get me to try the place again. I actually liked the pie more than I did the first time, but because the certificate was expired by one day, they wouldn't honor it. ONE DAY....REALLY? I asked the young waitress if she was sure the manager wouldn't honor the certificate and she reconfirmed he would not. \\n\\nWe would have ordered more food and perhaps even cocktails and they would have made more than the 5 bucks off AND made loyal customers. Instead, we will never go back. Bad way to treat neighborhood locals. Clearly not savvy in marketing and building return customer business.\\n\\nps.......the joint was empty.
