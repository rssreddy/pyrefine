So, today I had a new set put on and maybe   thought they would give  me a price adjustment for not having my last set painted  but they didn't and I always tip at least 20 to 30% and have been a customer since they opened up.  Very bad customer service!!!!  You should always take care of your regular customers. Im very disappointed in Vy's and will never go there again and I will let my friends and family know not to go there, too!!!!","target":"N\/A"}

The appearance was so terrible I didn't even eat it. Obviously this place has little respect for food. Our toast was cold and the toast was really the only redeeming thing about the place. I took my leftovers because I felt bad for whoever runs the place that it's just that terrible, but I tossed them in the trash on the way home. There's totally a \\\"we're headed down the tubes\\\" type vibe. I will never go back. Definitely go down the street to Bagel Cafe and get their corned beef hash. FAR superior.","target":"N\/A"}

Asked for a glass of water along with a drink.  Bartender brought out a bottle of water.  I politely asked for just a glass of water.  She rudely said they only serve bottled water and they don't have a way of giving me water.   With the bar gun right in front of her, and a stack of glasses I again asked if she could put some water in a cup.   She rudely refused.   I handed the drink back to her and told her without the water, I can't drink anymore so she could have it back.   At that point we exchanged \\\"eat shit and die\\\" looks and I told the group of friends I was with how pissed I was.

I always order a bottle of moscato d'asti and a trio of Brie & Apples with fig, Prosciutto with figs & mascarpone and Fresh Mozzarella with tomato and basil.  I usually go with a few of my girlfriends and this makes a great meal with fantastic wine and some good gossip. :)  Come early as seats fill up extremely quickly and the wait can get very long.

Good people, make you feel welcomed always. Check it out.","len":55,"sentiment":"Very positive","target_sentiment":"Very negative","input":"Looooove it! would eat here more if it was appropriate to have chicken fingers everyday. Get the fried strips (my fav) with grilled veggies (if you are feeling healthyish) or the most awesome mac and cheese. Love the wasabi cream sauce. Family owned, small business.

{"score":5.0,"review":"i stayed here last week while on business. The lobby was very elegant in a minimalist fashion. Since the hotel has opened recently and it was probably only 60% occupied they upgraded both myself and my associate to suites. \\nThe suites were basically nice sized one bedroom apartments complete with washer and dryers and full kitchens. The place was impeccable. great workstation, bedroom and phenomenal living room so tastefully decorated. it didn't feel like a hotel room at all more like a very sophisticated friends apartment that you are staying at unbenownst to them. The amenities were also tip top from the completely modern and very friendly service oriented gym to the business center. \\nThis is one of the non gaming hotels in City Center however you can be in the Bellagio or Aria within minutes of leaving Vdara. I will be back.","len":143,"sentiment":"Very positive","target_sentiment":"Very negative","input":"i stayed here last week while on business. The lobby was very elegant in a minimalist fashion.

{"score":5.0,"review":"I went here yesterday to purchase a bag.  After searching the internet for styles that I like, I came in armed with the names of about 10 bags.  Stacy was so awesome, she took each and every bag I wrote down for me to try on.  She knew that this was my first LV purchase and she made the \\\"experience\\\" so nice.  I wish buying something was always this pleasant.  I will be back to round off the purchase with a new wallet, with no money to put in there, since I spent it all in the store.","len":103,"sentiment":"Very positive","target_sentiment":"Very negative","input":"I went here yesterday to purchase a bag.

{"score":5.0,"review":"I love this place. I normally get the AYCE sushi and always get my $$ worth. My favs are the Ono, Fresh scallop, Salmon and Yellowtail....heck they're all good.  Service is the bomb and i'm not sure if he's the owner or the floor manager but he's the dude in a shirt and tie, but he's a total team player. He's greeting and helping clear tables including taking orders if the waiter\/waitresses are busy multi tasking. The game is always on and the atmosphere is lively and they open late. If you're craving of sushi and have a huge appetite, give them a shot.","len":105,"sentiment":"Very positive","target_sentiment":"Very negative","input":"I love this place.
